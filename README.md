PCBS Final project : Perceptual selection based on alphanumeric class

The purpose of the project is to simulate the experiments described in the article "Perceptual selection based on alphanumeric class" (Duncan 1983).

In this article, participants are shown biref displays of digits and letters. There were two different reports. In the partial report, participants are asked to report as many digits as possible, while ignoring the letters (or vice versa). In the whole report, they are asked to report both digits and letters.

There are two main findings.
1. Participants would report more letters in the partial report than in the whole report (same for digits)
2. When letters can be ignored, the probability of reporting a given digit increases as the total number of digits decreases (and vice versa for letters)

In this work, I shall therefore simulate the same experiments and try to get the same results as in the article.
